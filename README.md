# Project Overview

## Description

This project is focused on creating a terminal-based graphical system that utilizes the `curses` library to render visuals and display specific content. The project is designed to handle low-level screen drawing, pixel manipulation, and dynamic content rendering based on given inputs like fonts and views.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Screen Rendering**: Uses `curses` to handle screen updates and rendering of characters or pixels.
- **Modular Structure**: Contains separate modules for font management, view logic, and mechanism handling, promoting clean and maintainable code.
- **Input Handling**: The system manages screen operations like positioning, sizing, and updating with configurable settings.
- **Interpolation Logic**: Handles pixel interpolation for smooth rendering and scaling of visuals.
  
## Modules Overview

### 1. `mechanism.py`

This module handles the core logic for managing the graphical mechanism of the application. It includes the primary methods for interacting with the terminal screen, updating content, and managing the visual state.

### 2. `view.py`

The `view` module contains logic for handling the visual components of the system. It manages the representation of data on the screen, organizing the layout and controlling how information is displayed.

### 3. `font.py`

The `font` module is responsible for managing text and pixel-based rendering of fonts. It contains methods to define and manipulate how fonts appear on the screen.

### 4. `ptock`

This file might represent specific settings or configurations for managing different aspects of the application, potentially acting as a control file for the core mechanism.

## Usage

The project is intended to be run in a terminal environment, where the graphical content is rendered using the `curses` library. The files are modular, allowing for customization and extension based on specific project needs.
